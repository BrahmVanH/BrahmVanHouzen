            My names Brahm. As a resident of the Great Lakes State, I live on the coast of 
            lake superior in the beautiful Marquette, Michigan. I've spent the bulk of my time here,
            since 2016, studying Sports Science, with a heavy focus on the physiology of training 
            for endurance and ultra-endurance. As an alumn of Northern Michigan University, I've since
            oriented my career goals towards tech and full-stack web development. I currently attend 
            Michigan State University's Full-Stack Web Development certificate program. Outside of academia,
            I my passions include ultra-endurance mountain biking, playing bass guitar, rock and ice climbing, 
            and SCUBA diving. As a professional, I wear many hats. Currently, I work full time as a service 
            technician at Down Wind Sports. Just as well, I fulfill building maintenance, using my experience as 
            an electrician, as well as other trade skills I've learned in the construction industry, at Ore Dock 
            Brewing Co. Twice a year, my fellow installation technicians and I, operating as Superior Installations,
            make a tour through the north west corner of the US to install and remove inflatable water parks.
