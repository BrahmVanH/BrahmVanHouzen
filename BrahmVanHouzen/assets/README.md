                <h3>Me</h3>
                <p>	I am a student developer based out of Marquette, Michigan. Most of my professional experience has
                    arisen from my history as an independent electrician and professional commercial SCUBA diver.
                    Although my time on the keyboard has been limited thus far, I anticipate hitting the ground 
                    running with this soon-to-be newly acquired certificate. </p>
